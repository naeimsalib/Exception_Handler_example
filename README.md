# Exception_Handler_example
here I write my Own Exception handler in Java, and depending on what the error is , there would be a error handler for it.<br />
The Program check the information Provided, which is a name and a sof=cial security Number, and it checks if it is a valide Social Security Formate.
and using Exception handler, I would output an erro "Invalid Socuial Security number, " then what type of error it is < br />
As Shown Below < br />
